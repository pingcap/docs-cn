# Changefeed DDL Replication

This document describes the rules and special cases of DDL replication in TiCDC.

## DDL allow list

Currently, TiCDC uses an allow list to determine whether to replicate a DDL statement. Only the DDL statements in the allow list are replicated to the downstream. The DDL statements not in the allow list are not replicated.

The allow list of DDL statements supported by TiCDC is as follows:

- create database
- drop database
- create table
- drop table
- add column
- drop column
- create index / add index
- drop index
- truncate table
- modify column
- rename table
- alter column default value
- alter table comment
- rename index
- add partition
- drop partition
- truncate partition
- create view
- drop view
- alter table character set
- alter database character set
- recover table
- add primary key
- drop primary key
- rebase auto id
- alter table index visibility
- exchange partition
- reorganize partition
- alter table ttl
- alter table remove ttl

## DDL replication considerations

### Asynchronous execution of `ADD INDEX` and `CREATE INDEX` DDLs

When the downstream is TiDB, TiCDC executes `ADD INDEX` and `CREATE INDEX` DDL operations asynchronously to minimize the impact on changefeed replication latency. This means that, after replicating `ADD INDEX` and `CREATE INDEX` DDLs to the downstream TiDB for execution, TiCDC returns immediately without waiting for the completion of the DDL execution. This avoids blocking subsequent DML executions.

> **Note:**
>
> - If the execution of certain downstream DMLs relies on indexes that have not completed replication, these DMLs might be executed slowly, thereby affecting TiCDC replication latency.
> - Before replicating DDLs to the downstream, if a TiCDC node crashes or if the downstream is performing other write operations, the DDL replication has an extremely low probability of failure. You can check the downstream to see whether that occurs.

### DDL replication considerations for renaming tables

Due to the lack of some context during the replication process, TiCDC has some constraints on the replication of `RENAME TABLE` DDLs.

#### Rename a single table in a DDL statement

If a DDL statement renames a single table, TiCDC only replicates the DDL statement when the old table name matches the filter rule. The following is an example.

Assume that the configuration file of your changefeed is as follows:

```toml
[filter]
rules = ['test.t*']
```

TiCDC processes this type of DDL as follows:

| DDL | Whether to replicate | Reason for the handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RENAME TABLE test.t1 TO test.t2` | Replicate | `test.t1` matches the filter rule |
| `RENAME TABLE test.t1 TO ignore.t1` | Replicate | `test.t1` matches the filter rule |
| `RENAME TABLE ignore.t1 TO ignore.t2` | Ignore | `ignore.t1` does not match the filter rule |
| `RENAME TABLE test.n1 TO test.t1` | Report an error and exit the replication | `test.n1` does not match the filter rule, but `test.t1` matches the filter rule. This operation is illegal. In this case, refer to the error message for handling. |
| `RENAME TABLE ignore.t1 TO test.t1` | Report an error and exit the replication | Same reason as above. |

#### Rename multiple tables in a DDL statement

If a DDL statement renames multiple tables, TiCDC only replicates the DDL statement when the old database name, old table names, and the new database name all match the filter rule.

In addition, TiCDC does not support the `RENAME TABLE` DDL that swaps the table names. The following is an example.

Assume that the configuration file of your changefeed is as follows:

```toml
[filter]
rules = ['test.t*']
```

TiCDC processes this type of DDL as follows:

| DDL | Whether to replicate | Reason for the handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RENAME TABLE test.t1 TO test.t2, test.t3 TO test.t4` | Replicate | All database names and table names match the filter rule. |
| `RENAME TABLE test.t1 TO test.ignore1, test.t3 TO test.ignore2` | Replicate | The old database name, the old table names, and the new database name match the filter rule. |
| `RENAME TABLE test.t1 TO ignore.t1, test.t2 TO test.t22;` | Report an error | The new database name `ignore` does not match the filter rule. |
| `RENAME TABLE test.t1 TO test.t4, test.t3 TO test.t1, test.t4 TO test.t3;` | Report an error | The `RENAME TABLE` DDL swaps the names of `test.t1` and `test.t3` in one DDL statement, which TiCDC cannot handle correctly. In this case, refer to the error message for handling. |

### SQL mode

By default, TiCDC uses the default SQL mode of TiDB to parse DDL statements. If your upstream TiDB cluster uses a non-default SQL mode, you must specify the SQL mode in the TiCDC configuration file. Otherwise, TiCDC might fail to parse DDL statements correctly. For more information about TiDB SQL mode, see [SQL Mode](/sql-mode.md).

For example, if the upstream TiDB cluster uses the `ANSI_QUOTES` mode, you must specify the SQL mode in the changefeed configuration file as follows:

```toml
# In the value, "ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION" is the default SQL mode of TiDB.
# "ANSI_QUOTES" is the SQL mode added to your upstream TiDB cluster.

sql-mode = "ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION,ANSI_QUOTES"
```

If the SQL mode is not configured, TiCDC might fail to parse some DDL statements correctly. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "t1" ("a" int PRIMARY KEY);
```

Because in the default SQL mode of TiDB, double quotation marks are treated as strings rather than identifiers, TiCDC fails to parse the DDL statement correctly.

Therefore, when creating a replication task, it is recommended that you specify the SQL mode used by the upstream TiDB cluster in the configuration file.
