# Hybrid Search

By using full-text search, you can retrieve documents based on exact keywords. By using vector search, you can retrieve documents based on semantic similarity. Can we combine these two search methods to improve the retrieval quality and handle more scenarios? Yes, this approach is known as hybrid search and is commonly used in AI applications.

A general workflow of hybrid search in TiDB is as follows:

1. Use TiDB for **full-text search** and **vector search**.
2. Use a **reranker** to combine the results from both searches.

This tutorial demonstrates how to use hybrid search in TiDB with the [pytidb](https://github.com/pingcap/pytidb) Python SDK, which provides built-in support for embedding and reranking. Using pytidb is completely optional — you can perform a search using SQL directly and use your own reranking model as you like.

## Prerequisites

Full-text search is still in the early stages, and we are continuously rolling it out to more customers. Currently, Full-text search is only available on {{{ .starter }}} and {{{ .essential }}} in the following regions:

- AWS: `Frankfurt (eu-central-1)` and `Singapore (ap-southeast-1)`

To complete this tutorial, make sure you have a {{{ .starter }}} cluster in a supported region. If you don't have one, follow [Creating a {{{ .starter }}} cluster](/develop/dev-guide-build-cluster-in-cloud.md) to create it.

## Get started

### Step 1. Install the [pytidb](https://github.com/pingcap/pytidb) Python SDK

```shell
pip install "pytidb[models]"

# (Alternative) If you don't want to use built-in embedding functions and rerankers:
# pip install pytidb

# (Optional) To convert query results to pandas DataFrame:
# pip install pandas
```

### Step 2. Connect to TiDB

```python
from pytidb import TiDBClient

db = TiDBClient.connect(
    host="HOST_HERE",
    port=4000,
    username="USERNAME_HERE",
    password="PASSWORD_HERE",
    database="DATABASE_HERE",
)
```

You can get these connection parameters from the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com):

1. Navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/project/clusters) page, and then click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

2. Click **Connect** in the upper-right corner. A connection dialog is displayed, with connection parameters listed.

   For example, if the connection parameters are displayed as follows:

   ```text
   HOST:     gateway01.us-east-1.prod.shared.aws.tidbcloud.com
   PORT:     4000
   USERNAME: 4EfqPF23YKBxaQb.root
   PASSWORD: abcd1234
   DATABASE: test
   CA:       /etc/ssl/cert.pem
   ```

   The corresponding Python code to connect to the {{{ .starter }}} cluster would be as follows:

   ```python
   db = TiDBClient.connect(
       host="gateway01.us-east-1.prod.shared.aws.tidbcloud.com",
       port=4000,
       username="4EfqPF23YKBxaQb.root",
       password="abcd1234",
       database="test",
   )
   ```

   Note that the preceding example is for demonstration purposes only. You need to fill in the parameters with your own values and keep them secure.

### Step 3. Create a table

As an example, create a table named `chunks` with the following columns:

- `id` (int): the ID of the chunk.
- `text` (text): the text content of the chunk.
- `text_vec` (vector): the vector representation of the text, automatically generated by the embedding model in pytidb.
- `user_id` (int): the ID of the user who created the chunk.

```python
from pytidb.schema import TableModel, Field
from pytidb.embeddings import EmbeddingFunction

text_embed = EmbeddingFunction("openai/text-embedding-3-small")

class Chunk(TableModel, table=True):
    __tablename__ = "chunks"

    id: int = Field(primary_key=True)
    text: str = Field()
    text_vec: list[float] = text_embed.VectorField(
        source_field="text"
    )  # 👈 Define the vector field.
    user_id: int = Field()

table = db.create_table(schema=Chunk)
```

### Step 4. Insert data

```python
table.bulk_insert(
    [
        Chunk(id=2, text="bar", user_id=2),   # 👈 The text field will be embedded to a
        Chunk(id=3, text="baz", user_id=3),   # vector and stored in the "text_vec" field
        Chunk(id=4, text="qux", user_id=4),   # automatically.
    ]
)
```

### Step 5. Perform a hybrid search

In this example, use the [jina-reranker](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-reranker-m0) model to rerank the search results.

```python
from pytidb.rerankers import Reranker

jinaai = Reranker(model_name="jina_ai/jina-reranker-m0")

df = (
  table.search("<query>", search_type="hybrid")
    .rerank(jinaai, "text")  # 👈 Rerank the query result using the jinaai model.
    .limit(2)
    .to_pandas()
)
```
