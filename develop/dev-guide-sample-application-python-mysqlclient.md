# Connect to TiDB with mysqlclient

TiDB is a MySQL-compatible database, and [mysqlclient](https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient) is a popular open-source driver for Python.

In this tutorial, you can learn how to use TiDB and mysqlclient to accomplish the following tasks:

- Set up your environment.
- Connect to your TiDB cluster using mysqlclient.
- Build and run your application. Optionally, you can find sample code snippets for basic CRUD operations.

> **Note:**
>
> This tutorial works with TiDB Serverless, TiDB Dedicated, and TiDB Self-Hosted.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- [Python **3.10** or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- A TiDB cluster.

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

**If you don't have a TiDB cluster, you can create one as follows:**

- (Recommended) Follow [Creating a TiDB Serverless cluster](/develop/dev-guide-build-cluster-in-cloud.md) to create your own TiDB Cloud cluster.
- Follow [Deploy a local test TiDB cluster](/quick-start-with-tidb.md#deploy-a-local-test-cluster) or [Deploy a production TiDB cluster](/production-deployment-using-tiup.md) to create a local cluster.

## Run the sample app to connect to TiDB

This section demonstrates how to run the sample application code and connect to TiDB.

### Step 1: Clone the sample app repository

Run the following commands in your terminal window to clone the sample code repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tidb-samples/tidb-python-mysqlclient-quickstart.git
cd tidb-python-mysqlclient-quickstart;
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the required packages (including `mysqlclient`) for the sample app:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you encounter installation issues, refer to the [mysqlclient official documentation](https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient#install).

### Step 3: Configure connection information

Connect to your TiDB cluster depending on the TiDB deployment option you've selected.

<SimpleTab>
<div label="TiDB Serverless">

1. Navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page, and then click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

2. Click **Connect** in the upper-right corner. A connection dialog is displayed.

3. Ensure the configurations in the connection dialog match your operating environment.

    - **Endpoint Type** is set to `Public`
    - **Connect With** is set to `General`
    - **Operating System** matches your environment.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > If your program is running in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), switch to the corresponding Linux distribution.

4. Click **Create password** to create a random password.

    > **Tip:**
    > 
    > If you have created a password before, you can either use the original password or click **Reset password** to generate a new one.

5. Run the following command to copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`:

    ```shell
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

6. Copy and paste the corresponding connection string into the `.env` file. The example result is as follows:

    ```dotenv
    TIDB_HOST='{gateway-region}.aws.tidbcloud.com'
    TIDB_PORT='4000'
    TIDB_USER='{prefix}.root'
    TIDB_PASSWORD='{password}'
    TIDB_DB_NAME='test'
    CA_PATH=''
    ```

    Be sure to replace the placeholders `{}` with the connection parameters obtained from the connection dialog.

    TiDB Serverless requires a secure connection. Since the `ssl_mode` of mysqlclient defaults to `PREFERRED`, you don't need to manually specify `CA_PATH`. Just leave it empty. But if you have a special reason to specify `CA_PATH` manually, you can refer to the [TLS connections to TiDB Serverless](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/secure-connections-to-serverless-clusters) to get the certificate paths for different operating systems.

7. Save the `.env` file.

</div>
<div label="TiDB Dedicated">

1. Navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page, and then click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

2. Click **Connect** in the upper-right corner. A connection dialog is displayed.

3. Click **Allow Access from Anywhere** and then click **Download TiDB cluster CA** to download the CA certificate.

    For more details about how to obtain the connection string, refer to [TiDB Dedicated standard connection](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/connect-via-standard-connection).

4. Run the following command to copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`:

    ```shell
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. Copy and paste the corresponding connection string into the `.env` file. The example result is as follows:

    ```dotenv
    TIDB_HOST='{host}.clusters.tidb-cloud.com'
    TIDB_PORT='4000'
    TIDB_USER='{username}'
    TIDB_PASSWORD='{password}'
    TIDB_DB_NAME='test'
    CA_PATH='{your-downloaded-ca-path}'
    ```

    Be sure to replace the placeholders `{}` with the connection parameters obtained from the connection dialog, and configure `CA_PATH` with the certificate path downloaded in the previous step.

6. Save the `.env` file.

</div>
<div label="TiDB Self-Hosted">

1. Run the following command to copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`:

    ```shell
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Copy and paste the corresponding connection string into the `.env` file. The example result is as follows:

    ```dotenv
    TIDB_HOST='{tidb_server_host}'
    TIDB_PORT='4000'
    TIDB_USER='root'
    TIDB_PASSWORD='{password}'
    TIDB_DB_NAME='test'
    ```

    Be sure to replace the placeholders `{}` with the connection parameters, and remove the `CA_PATH` line. If you are running TiDB locally, the default host address is `127.0.0.1`, and the password is empty.

3. Save the `.env` file.

</div>
</SimpleTab>

### Step 4: Run the code and check the result

1. Execute the following command to run the sample code:

    ```shell
    python mysqlclient_example.py
    ```

2. Check the [Expected-Output.txt](https://github.com/tidb-samples/tidb-python-mysqlclient-quickstart/blob/main/Expected-Output.txt) to see if the output matches.

## Sample code snippets

You can refer to the following sample code snippets to complete your own application development.

For complete sample code and how to run it, check out the [tidb-samples/tidb-python-mysqlclient-quickstart](https://github.com/tidb-samples/tidb-python-mysqlclient-quickstart) repository.

### Connect to TiDB

```python
def get_mysqlclient_connection(autocommit:bool=True) -> MySQLdb.Connection:
    db_conf = {
        "host": ${tidb_host},
        "port": ${tidb_port},
        "user": ${tidb_user},
        "password": ${tidb_password},
        "database": ${tidb_db_name},
        "autocommit": autocommit
    }

    if ${ca_path}:
        db_conf["ssl_mode"] = "VERIFY_IDENTITY"
        db_conf["ssl"] = {"ca": ${ca_path}}

    return MySQLdb.connect(**db_conf)
```

When using this function, you need to replace `${tidb_host}`, `${tidb_port}`, `${tidb_user}`, `${tidb_password}`, `${tidb_db_name}` and `${ca_path}` with the actual values of your TiDB cluster.

### Insert data

```python
with get_mysqlclient_connection(autocommit=True) as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        player = ("1", 1, 1)
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO players (id, coins, goods) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)", player)
```

For more information, refer to [Insert data](/develop/dev-guide-insert-data.md).

### Query data

```python
with get_mysqlclient_connection(autocommit=True) as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("SELECT count(*) FROM players")
        print(cur.fetchone()[0])
```

For more information, refer to [Query data](/develop/dev-guide-get-data-from-single-table.md).

### Update data

```python
with get_mysqlclient_connection(autocommit=True) as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        player_id, amount, price="1", 10, 500
        cursor.execute(
            "UPDATE players SET goods = goods + %s, coins = coins + %s WHERE id = %s",
            (-amount, price, player_id),
        )
```

For more information, refer to [Update data](/develop/dev-guide-update-data.md).

### Delete data

```python
with get_mysqlclient_connection(autocommit=True) as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        player_id = "1"
        cursor.execute("DELETE FROM players WHERE id = %s", (player_id,))
```

For more information, refer to [Delete data](/develop/dev-guide-delete-data.md).

## Useful notes

### Using driver or ORM framework?

The Python driver provides low-level access to the database, but it requires the developers to:

- Manually establish and release database connections.
- Manually manage database transactions.
- Manually map data rows (represented as tuples in `mysqlclient`) to data objects.

Unless you need to write complex SQL statements, it is recommended to use [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Object-relational_mapping) framework for development, such as [SQLAlchemy](/develop/dev-guide-sample-application-python-sqlalchemy.md), [Peewee](/develop/dev-guide-sample-application-python-peewee.md), and Django ORM. It can help you:

- Reduce [boilerplate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) for managing connections and transactions.
- Manipulate data with data objects instead of a number of SQL statements.
