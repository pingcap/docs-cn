# Continuous Replication from Databases that Use gh-ost or pt-osc

In production scenarios, table locking during DDL execution can block the reads from or writes to the database to a certain extent. Therefore, online DDL tools are often used to execute DDLs to minimize the impact on reads and writes. Common DDL tools are [gh-ost](https://github.com/github/gh-ost) and [pt-osc](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/3.0/pt-online-schema-change.html).

When using DM to migrate data from MySQL to TiDB, you can enbale `online-ddl` to allow collaboration of DM and gh-ost or pt-osc.

For the detailed replication instructions, refer to the following documents by scenarios:

- [Migrate MySQL of Small Datasets to TiDB](/migrate-small-mysql-to-tidb.md)
- [Migrate MySQL of Large Datasets to TiDB](/migrate-large-mysql-to-tidb.md)
- [Migrate and Merge MySQL Shards of Small Datasets to TiDB](/migrate-small-mysql-shards-to-tidb.md)
- [Migrate and Merge MySQL Shards of Large Datasets to TiDB](/migrate-large-mysql-shards-to-tidb.md)

## Enable online-ddl on DM

In the task configuration file of DM, set the global parameter `online-ddl` to `true`, as shown below:

```yaml
# ----------- Global configuration -----------
## ********* Basic configuration *********
name: test                      # The name of the task. Should be globally unique.
task-mode: all                  # The task mode. Can be set to `full`, `incremental`, or `all`.
shard-mode: "pessimistic"       # The shard merge mode. Optional modes are `pessimistic` and `optimistic`. The `pessimistic` mode is used by default. After understanding the principles and restrictions of the "optimistic" mode, you can set it to the "optimistic" mode.
meta-schema: "dm_meta"          # The downstream database that stores the `meta` information.
online-ddl: true                # Enable online-ddl support on DM to support automatic processing of "gh-ost" and "pt-osc" for the upstream database.
```

## Workflow after enabling online-ddl

After online-ddl is enabled on DM, the DDL statements generated by DM replicating gh-ost or pt-osc will change.

The workflow of gh-ost or pt-osc:

- Create a ghost table according to the table schema of the DDL real table.

- Apply DDLs on the ghost table.

- Replicate the data of the DDL real table to the ghost table.

- After the data are consistent between the two tables, use the rename statement to replace the real table with the ghost table.

The workflow of DM:

- Skip creating the ghost table downstream.

- Record DDLs applied to the ghost table.

- Replicate data only from the ghost table.

- Apply DDLs recorded downstream.

The change in the workflow brings the following advantages:

- The downstream TiDB does not need to create and replicate the ghost table, saving the storage space and network transmission overhead.

- When you migrate and merge data from sharded tables, the RENAME operation is ignored for each sharded ghost table to ensure the correctness of the replication.
