# TiDB Operator

[TiDB Operator](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator) is an automatic operation system for TiDB clusters in Kubernetes. It provides full life-cycle management for TiDB including deployment, upgrades, scaling, backup, fail-over, and configuration changes. With TiDB Operator, TiDB can run seamlessly in the Kubernetes clusters deployed on a public or private cloud.

For the current TiDB release, the compatible version of TiDB Operator is v1.2.

Currently, the TiDB Operator documentation (also named as TiDB in Kubernetes documentation) is independent of the TiDB documentation. To access the documentation, click the following link:
