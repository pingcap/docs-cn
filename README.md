Welcome to TiDB documentation!

This repository stores all the source files of [TiDB Docs at the PingCAP website](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable), while the [pingcap/docs-cn](https://github.com/pingcap/docs-cn) repository stores all the source files of [TiDB Documentation in Chinese](https://docs.pingcap.com/zh/tidb/stable).

If you find documentation issues, feel free to [create an Issue](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/issues/new/choose) to let us know or directly [create a Pull Request](/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-contribute) to help fix or update it.

Currently, the official documentation supports two languages:
