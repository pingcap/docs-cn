# TiDB Binlog Local Deployment

## About TiDB Binlog Local

TiDB Binlog is a tool for enterprise users to collect binlog files for TiDB and provide near real-time backup and replication.

TiDB Binlog supports the following scenarios:

- **Data replication**: to replicate TiDB cluster data to other databases
- **Real-time backup and recovery**: to back up TiDB cluster data, and recover in case of cluster outages

## TiDB Binlog Local architecture

The TiDB Binlog architecture is as follows:

![TiDB Binlog architecture](/media/architecture.jpeg)

The TiDB Binlog cluster mainly consists of two components:

### Pump

Pump is a daemon that runs on the background of each TiDB host. Its main function is to record the binlog files generated by TiDB in real time and write to the file in the disk sequentially.

### Drainer

Drainer collects binlog files from each Pump node, converts them into specified database-compatible SQL statements in the commit order of the transactions in TiDB, and replicates to the target database or writes to the file sequentially.

## Install TiDB Binlog Local

### Download

TiDB Binlog can be [downloaded](/reference/tools/download.md) as part of the Enterprise Tools package.

### Deploy TiDB Binlog

- It is recommended to deploy Pump using TiDB Ansible.
- Build a new TiDB cluster with a startup order of pd-server -> tikv-server -> pump -> tidb-server -> drainer.
    - Edit the `tidb-ansible inventory.ini` file:

        ```ini
        enable_binlog = True
        ```

    - Run `ansible-playbook deploy.yml`
    - Run `ansible-playbook start.yml`

- Deploy Binlog for an existing TiDB cluster.
    - Edit the `tidb-ansible inventory.ini` file:

        ```ini
        enable_binlog = True
        ```

    - Run `ansible-playbook rolling_update.yml`

### Note

- You need to deploy a Pump for each TiDB server in a TiDB cluster. Currently, the TiDB server only supports the binlog in UNIX socket.

  We set the startup parameter `binlog-socket` as the specified unix socket file path of the corresponding parameter `socket` in Pump. The final deployment architecture is as follows:

  ![TiDB pump deployment architecture](/media/tidb_pump_deployment.jpeg)

- Currently, you need to deploy Drainer manually.

- Drainer does not support renaming DDL on the table of the ignored schemas (schemas in the filter list).

- To start Drainer in the existing TiDB cluster, usually you need to do a full backup, get the savepoint, import the full backup, and start Drainer and replicate from the savepoint.

- To guarantee the integrity of data, perform the following operations 10 minutes after Pump is started:

    - Run Drainer at the `gen-savepoint` model and generate the Drainer savepoint file:

        ```bash
        bin/drainer -gen-savepoint --data-dir= ${drainer_savepoint_dir} --pd-urls=${pd_urls}
        ```

    - Do a full backup. For example, back up TiDB using Mydumper.
    - Import the full backup to the target system.
    - Set the file path of the savepoint and start Drainer:

        ```bash
        bin/drainer --config=conf/drainer.toml --data-dir=${drainer_savepoint_dir}
        ```

- The drainer outputs `pb` and you need to set the following parameters in the configuration file.

    ```toml
    [syncer]
    db-type = "pb"
    disable-dispatch = true

    [syncer.to]
    dir = "/path/pb-dir"
    ```

## Monitor TiDB Binlog

This section introduces how to monitor TiDB Binlog's status and performance, and display the metrics using Prometheus and Grafana.

### Configure Pump/Drainer

Use the Pump service deployed using TiDB Ansible. Set metrics in startup parameters.

When you start Drainer, set the two parameters of `--metrics-addr` and `--metrics-interval`. Set `--metrics-addr` as the address of Push Gateway. Set `--metrics-interval` as the frequency of push (default 15 seconds).

### Configure Grafana

#### Create a Prometheus data source

1. Login the Grafana Web interface.

    - The default address is: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

    - The default account name: admin

    - The password for the default account: admin

2. Click the Grafana logo to open the sidebar menu.

3. Click "Data Sources" in the sidebar.

4. Click "Add data source".

5. Specify the data source information:

    - Specify the name for the data source.

    - For Type, select Prometheus.

    - For Url, specify the Prometheus address.

    - Specify other fields as needed.

6. Click "Add" to save the new data source.

#### Create a Grafana dashboard

1. Click the Grafana logo to open the sidebar menu.

2. On the sidebar menu, click "Dashboards" -> "Import" to open the "Import Dashboard" window.

3. Click "Upload .json File" to upload a JSON file (Download [TiDB Grafana Config](https://grafana.com/tidb)).

4. Click "Save & Open".

5. A Prometheus dashboard is created.
