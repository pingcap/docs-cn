# TiDB Cloud Quick Start

*Estimated completion time: 20 minutes*

This tutorial guides you through an easy way to get started with TiDB Cloud. You can also follow the step-by-step tutorials on the [**Getting Started**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/getting-started) page in the TiDB Cloud console.

Additionally, you can try out TiDB features on [TiDB Playground](https://play.tidbcloud.com/?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=tidb_cloud_quick_start).

## Step 1: Create a TiDB cluster

[TiDB Serverless](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless) is the best way to get started with TiDB Cloud. To create a TiDB Serverless cluster, follow these steps:

1. If you do not have a TiDB Cloud account, click [here](https://tidbcloud.com/free-trial) to sign up.

    You can sign up with your email and password to manage your password using TiDB Cloud, or choose to sign in with your Google, GitHub, or Microsoft account for single sign-on (SSO) to TiDB Cloud.

2. [Log in](https://tidbcloud.com/) to your TiDB Cloud account.

    The [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page is displayed by default.

3. For new sign-up users, TiDB Cloud automatically creates a default TiDB Serverless cluster named `Cluster0` for you.

    - To instantly try out TiDB Cloud features with this default cluster, proceed to [Step 2: Try AI-powered Chat2Query (beta)](#step-2-try-ai-powered-chat2query-beta).
    - To create a new TiDB Serverless cluster on your own, follow these steps:

        1. Click **Create Cluster**.
        2. On the **Create Cluster** page, **Serverless** is selected by default. Select the target region for your cluster, update the default cluster name if necessary, and then click **Create**. Your TiDB Serverless cluster will be created in approximately 30 seconds.

## Step 2: Try AI-powered Chat2Query (beta)

TiDB Cloud is powered by AI. You can use Chat2Query (beta), an AI-powered SQL editor in the TiDB Cloud console, to maximize the value of your data.

In Chat2Query, you can either simply type `--` followed by your instructions to let AI automatically generate SQL queries, or write SQL queries manually and run them against databases without using a terminal.

1. On the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page, click on a cluster name to go to its overview page, and then click **Chat2Query** in the left navigation pane.

2. To try the AI capacity of TiDB Cloud, follow the on-screen instructions to allow PingCAP and OpenAI to use your code snippets for research and service improvement, and then click **Save and Get Started**.

3. In the editor, you can either simply type `--` followed by your instructions to let AI automatically generate SQL queries, or write SQL queries manually.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > SQL queries generated by AI are not 100% accurate and might still require further tweaking.

4. Run the SQL queries.
