## Examples

Create a new role for the analytics team, and a new user called `jennifer`:

```sql
$ mysql -uroot
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql> CREATE ROLE analyticsteam;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> GRANT SELECT ON test.* TO analyticsteam;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> CREATE USER jennifer;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> GRANT analyticsteam TO jennifer;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

Note that by default `jennifer` needs to `SET ROLE analyticsteam` in order to be able to use the privileges associated with the role:

```sql
$ mysql -ujennifer

```

The statement `SET DEFAULT ROLE` can be used to associated a role to `jennifer` so that she will not have to execute the statement `SET ROLE` in order to assume the privileges associated with the role:

```sql
$ mysql -uroot
