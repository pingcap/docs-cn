    - Add `REGION_ID` in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TIDB_HOT_REGIONS` [#11350](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11350)
    - Cancel the timeout duration of obtaining Region information from the PD API to ensure that obtaining Region information will not end in a failure when TiDB API `http://{TiDBIP}:10080/regions/hot` is called due to PD timeout when the number of Regions is large [#11383](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11383)
    - Fix the issue that Region related requests do not return partitioned table-related Regions in the HTTP API [#11466](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11466)
    - Make the following changes to reduce the probability of locking timeout caused by slow operations when the user manually validates pessimistic locking [#11521](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11521):
        - Increase the default TTL of pessimistic locking from 30 seconds to 40 seconds
        - Increase the maximum TTL from 60 seconds to 120 seconds
        - Calculate the pessimistic locking duration from the first `LockKeys` request
    - Change the `SendRequest` function logic in the TiKV client: try to immediately connect to another peer instead of keeping waiting when the connect cannot be built [#11531](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11531)
    - Optimize the Region cache: label the removed store as invalid when a store is moved while another store goes online with a same address, to update the store information in the cache as soon as possible [#11567](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11567)
    - Add the Region ID to the result returned by the `http://{TiDB_ADDRESS:TIDB_IP}/mvcc/key/{db}/{table}/{handle}` API [#11557](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11557)
    - Fix the issue that Scatter Table does not work caused by the Scatter Table API not escaping the Range key [#11298](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11298)
    - Optimize the Region cache: label the store where the Region exists as invalid when the correspondent store is inaccessible, to avoid reduced query performance caused by accessing this store [#11498](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11498)
    - Fix the error that the table schema can still be obtained through the HTTP API after dropping the database with the same name multiple times [#11585](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11585)
+ DDL
    - Fix the issue that an error occurs when a non-string column with a zero length is being indexed [#11214](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11214)
    - Disallow modifying the columns with foreign key constraints and full-text indexes (Note: TiDB still supports foreign key constraints and full-text indexes in syntax) [#11274](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11274)
    - Fix the issue that the index offset of the column might be wrong because the position changed by the `ALTER TABLE` statement and the default value of the column are used concurrently [#11346](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11346)
    - Fix two issues that occur when parsing JSON files:
        - `int64` is used as the intermediate parsing result of `uint64` in `ConvertJSONToFloat`, which leads to the precision overflow error [#11433](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11433)
        - `int64` is used as the intermediate parsing result of `uint64` in `ConvertJSONToInt`, which leads to the precision overflow error [#11551](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11551)
    - Disallow dropping indexes on the auto-increment column to avoid that the auto-increment column might get an incorrect result [#11399](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11399)
    - Fix the following issues [#11492](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11492):
        - The character set and the collation of the column are not consistent when explicitly specifying the collation but not the character set
        - The error is not correctly reported when there is a conflict between the character set and the collation that are specified by `ALTER TABLE … MODIFY COLUMN`
        - Incompatibility with MySQL when using `ALTER TABLE … MODIFY COLUMN` to specify character sets and collations multiple times
    - Add the trace details of the subquery to the result of the `TRACE` query [#11458](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11458)
    - Optimize the performance of executing `ADMIN CHECK TABLE` and greatly reduce its execution time [#11547](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11547)
    - Add the result returned by `SPLIT TABLE … REGIONS/INDEX` and make `TOTAL_SPLIT_REGION` and `SCATTER_FINISH_RATIO` display the number of Regions that have been split successfully before timeout in the result [#11484](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11484)
    - Fix the issue that the precision displayed by statements like `SHOW CREATE TABLE` is incomplete when `ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` is the column attribute and the float precision is specified [#11591](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11591)
    - Fix the issue that the index result of the column cannot be correctly calculated when the expression of a virtual generated column contains another virtual generated column [#11475](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11475)
    - Fix the issue that the minus sign cannot be added after `VALUE LESS THAN` in the `ALTER TABLE … ADD PARTITION …` statement [#11581](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11581)
+ Monitor
    - Fix the issue that data is not collected and reported because the `TiKVTxnCmdCounter` monitoring metric is not registered [#11316](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11316)
    - Add the `BindUsageCounter`, `BindTotalGauge` and `BindMemoryUsage` monitoring metrics for the Bind Info [#11467](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/11467)
