# TiDB 2.0.1 Release Notes

On May 16, 2018, TiDB 2.0.1 is released. Compared with TiDB 2.0.0 (GA), this release has great improvement in MySQL compatibility and system stability.

## TiDB

- Update the progress of `Add Index` to the DDL job information in real time
- Add the `tidb_auto_analyze_ratio` session variable to control the threshold value of automatic statistics update
- Fix an issue that not all residual states are cleaned up when the transaction commit fails
- Fix a bug about adding indexes in some conditions
- Fix the correctness related issue when DDL modifies surface operations in some concurrent scenarios
- Fix a bug that the result of `LIMIT` is incorrect in some conditions
- Fix a capitalization issue of the `ADMIN CHECK INDEX` statement to make its index name case insensitive
- Fix a compatibility issue of the `UNION` statement
- Fix a compatibility issue when inserting data of `TIME` type
- Fix a goroutine leak issue caused by `copIteratorTaskSender` in some conditions
- Add an option for TiDB to control the behaviour of Binlog failure
- Refactor the `Coprocessor` slow log to distinguish between the scenario of tasks with long processing time and long waiting time
- Log nothing when meeting MySQL protocol handshake error, to avoid too many logs caused by the load balancer Keep Alive mechanism
- Refine the “Out of range value for column” error message
- Fix a bug when there is a subquery in an `Update` statement
- Change the behaviour of handling `SIGTERM`, and do not wait for all queries to terminate anymore

## PD

- Optimize the scheduling of Merge Region to prevent the newly split Region from being merged
- Add Learner related metrics
- Fix the issue that the scheduler is mistakenly deleted after restart
- Fix the error that occurs when parsing the configuration file
- Fix the issue that the etcd leader and the PD leader are not synchronized
- Fix the issue that Learner still appears after it is closed
- Fix the issue that Regions fail to load because the packet size is too large

## TiKV

- Fix the issue that `SELECT FOR UPDATE` prevents others from reading
- Optimize the slow query log
- Reduce the number of `thread_yield` calls
- Fix the bug that raftstore is accidentally blocked when generating the snapshot
- Fix the issue that Learner cannot be successfully elected in special conditions
- Fix the issue that split might cause dirty read in extreme conditions
