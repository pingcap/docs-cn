# TiDB 3.0.4 Release Notes

Release date: October 8, 2019

TiDB version: 3.0.4

TiDB Ansible version: 3.0.4

- New features
    - Add the `performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest` system table to troubleshoot performance issues at the SQL level
    - Add the `WHERE` clause in TiDB’s `SHOW TABLE REGIONS` syntax
    - Add the `worker-count` and `txn-batch` configuration items in Reparo to control the recovery speed
- Improvements
    - Support batch Region split command and empty split command in TiKV to improve split performance
    - Support double linked list for RocksDB in TiKV to improve performance of reverse scan
    - Add two perf tools `iosnoop` and `funcslower` in TiDB Ansible to better diagnose the cluster state
    - Optimize the output of slow query logs in TiDB by deleting redundant fields
- Changed behaviors
    - Update the default value of `txn-local-latches.enable` to `false` to disable the default behavior of checking conflicts of local transactions in TiDB
    - Add the `tidb_txn_mode` system variable of global scope in TiDB and allow using the pessimistic lock; note that TiDB still adopts the optimistic lock by default
    - Replace the `Index_ids` field in TiDB slow query logs with `Index_names` to improve the usability of slow query logs
    - Add the `split-region-max-num` parameter in the TiDB configuration file to modify the maximum number of Regions allowed in the `SPLIT TABLE` syntax
    - Return the `Out Of Memory Quota` error instead of disconnecting the link when a SQL execution exceeds the memory limit
    - Disallow dropping the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute of columns in TiDB to avoid misoperations. To drop this attribute, change the `tidb_allow_remove_auto_inc` system variable
- Fixed Issues
    - Fix the issue that the uncommented TiDB-specific syntax `PRE_SPLIT_REGIONS` might cause errors in the downstream database during data replication
    - Fix the issue in TiDB that the slow query logs are incorrect when getting the result of `PREPARE` + `EXECUTE` by using the cursor
    - Fix the issue in PD that adjacent small Regions cannot be merged
    - Fix the issue in TiKV that file descriptor leak in idle clusters might cause TiKV processes to exit abnormally when the processes run for a long time
