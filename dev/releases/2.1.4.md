# TiDB 2.1.4 Release Notes

On February 15, 2019, TiDB 2.1.4 is released. The corresponding TiDB-Ansible 2.1.4 is also released. Compared with TiDB 2.1.3, this release has greatly improved the stability, the SQL optimizer, statistics, and the execution engine.

## TiDB

+ SQL Optimizer/Executor
    - Fix the issue that the `VALUES` function does not handle the FLOAT type correctly [#9223](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/9223)
    - Fix the wrong result issue when casting Float to String in some cases [#9227](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/9227)
    - Fix the wrong result issue of the `FORMAT` function in some cases [#9235](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/9235)
    - Fix the panic issue when handling the Join query in some cases [#9264](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/9264)
    - Fix the issue that the `VALUES` function does not handle the ENUM type correctly [#9280](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/9280)
    - Fix the wrong result issue of `DATE_ADD`/`DATE_SUB` in some cases [#9284](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/9284)
+ Server
    - Optimize the “reload privilege success” log and change it to the DEBUG level [#9274](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/9274)
+ DDL
    - Change `tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt` and `tidb_ddl_reorg_batch_size` to global variables [#9134](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/9134)
    - Fix the bug caused by adding an index to a generated column in some abnormal conditions [#9289](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/9289)

## TiKV

- Fix the duplicate write issue when closing TiKV [#4146](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/4146)
- Fix the abnormal result issue of the event listener in some cases [#4132](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/4132)

## Tools

+ Lightning
    - Optimize the memory usage [#107](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-lightning/pull/107), [#108](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-lightning/pull/108)
    - Remove the chunk separation of dump files to avoid an extra parsing of dump files [#109](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-lightning/pull/109)
    - Limit the I/O concurrency of reading dump files, to avoid performance degradation caused by too many cache misses [#110](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-lightning/pull/110)
    - Support importing data in batches for a single table, to improve import stability [#110](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-lightning/pull/113)
    - Enable auto compactions in the import mode in TiKV [#4199](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/4199)
    - Support disabling the TiKV periodic Level-1 compaction parameter, because the Level-1 compaction is automatically executed in the import mode when the TiKV cluster version is 2.1.4 or later [#119](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-lightning/pull/119)
    - Limit the number of import engines to avoid consuming too much importer disk space [#119](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-lightning/pull/119)
+ Support splitting chunks using the TiDB statistics in sync-diff-inspector [#197](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-tools/pull/197)
