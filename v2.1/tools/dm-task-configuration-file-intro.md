# Data Migration Task Configuration File

This document introduces the task configuration file of Data Migration --
[`task.yaml`](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-tools/blob/docs/docs/dm/zh_CN/configuration/task.yaml), including [Global configuration](#global-configuration) and [Instance configuration](#instance-configuration).

For description of configuration items, see [Data Migration Task Configuration Options](../tools/dm-task-config-argument-description.md).

## Important concepts

For description of important concepts including `instance-id` and the DM-worker ID, see [Important concepts](../tools/dm-configuration-file-overview.md#important-concepts). 

## Global configuration

### Basic information configuration

```
name: test                      # The name of the task. Should be globally unique.
task-mode: all                  # The task mode. Can be set to `full`/`incremental`/`all`.
is-sharding: true               # Whether it is a sharding task
meta-schema: "dm_meta"          # The downstream database that stores the `meta` information
remove-meta: false              # Whether to remove the `meta` information (`checkpoint` and `onlineddl`) before starting the 
                                # replication task 

target-database:                # Configuration of the downstream database instance
    host: "192.168.0.1"
    port: 4000
    user: "root"
    password: ""
```

For more details of `task-mode`, see [Task configuration argument description](../tools/dm-task-config-argument-description.md).

### Feature configuration set

Global configuration includes the following feature configuration set.

```

## Instance configuration

This part defines the subtask of data replication. DM supports replicating data from one or multiple MySQL instances to the same instance.
