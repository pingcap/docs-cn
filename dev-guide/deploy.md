# Build for deployment

The easiest way to deploy TiDB is to use Docker Compose, see [TiDB Docker Compose Deployment](../dev/how-to/get-started/deploy-tidb-from-docker-compose.md). For more deployment methods, see [TiDB deployment methods](../_index.md).

## Before you begin

You need to check the [supported platforms](./requirements.md#supported-platforms) and [prerequisites](./requirements.md#prerequisites) first.

## Build and install TiDB components

You can use the [build script](../scripts/build.sh) to build and install TiDB components in the `bin` directory.

You can use the [update script](../scripts/update.sh) to update all the TiDB components to the latest version.
